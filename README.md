The goal of this Raindrop game is prevent the falling raindrops from reaching the ground. To do so, a raindrop must come in contact with the catcher. If 15 raindrops reach the end, the game terminates. Once the first raindrop comes in contact with the catcher, a score will appear in the upper left hand corner,increasing by 1 for each raindrop caught. Scores over 100 are notable and scores over 250 are very impressive! Have fun!
