The goal of this Raindrop game is prevent the falling raindrops from reaching the ground. To do so, a raindrop must come in contact with the catcher. If 15 raindrops reach the end, the game terminates. Once the first raindrop comes in contact with the catcher, a random color will overcome the previous color. This is in place to add confusion, hence making the game slightly more challenging. Scores over 100 are notable and scores over 250 are very impressive! Have fun!
